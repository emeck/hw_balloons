ABOUT
-----

 Balloons is a simple game for small kids, the objective is to pop 15
 balloons in less than 30 seconds. That is all.

 I started it as a way to learn the basics of Hollywood-MAL programming,
 inspired by a tutorial for Scratch 2 which you can find here:
 https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/balloons-scratch2

 After completing the features of the Scratch tutorial I added some more:
 - a start menu
 - player's name
 - highscore table
 - sound effects
 - localization

 I hope some kids will enjoy it for a while. And it might help others to
 start programming in Hollywood too.


INSTALLATION
------------
 Just unpack the archive wherever you like and launch the program. Linux
 users need to set the executable bit.The first time you run it, an empty
 highscores table will be created.


TO DO
-----
 - Changing fullscreen/window mode from the start menu
 - SDL version (some day)
 - Vector graphics (two more weeks?)


Special thanks to

 jPV for testing and bug fixing, but mostly for the suggestions and code
 correction.
