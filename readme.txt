ABOUT
-----

 Balloons is a simple game, the objective is to pop 15 balloons in less
 than 10 seconds. That is all.

 I started it as a way to learn the basics of Hollywood-MAL programming,
 inspired by a tutorial for Scratch 2 which you can find here:
 https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/balloons-scratch2

 After completing the features of the Scratch tutorial I added some more:
 - a start menu
 - player's name
 - highscore table
 - sound effects
 - localization

 I hope some kids will enjoy it for a while. And it might help others to
 start programming in Hollywood too.


INSTALLATION
------------
 Just unpack the archive wherever you like and launch the program. The
 first time you run it, an empty highscores table will be created.
